> - If you would like to add a `volume` adapter please submit the PR [here](https://github.com/DefiLlama/adapters).
> - If you would like to add a `liquidations` adapter, please refer to [this readme document](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/tree/main/liquidations) for details.

1. Once your adapter has been merged, it takes time to show on the UI. If more than 24 hours have passed, please let us know in Discord.
2. Sorry, We no longer accept fetch adapter for new projects, we prefer the tvl to computed from blockchain data, if you have trouble with creating a the adapter, please hop onto our discord, we are happy to assist you.
3. Please fill the form below  **only if the PR is for listing a new protocol** else it can be ignored/replaced with reason/details about the PR
4. **For updating listing info** It is a different repo, you can find your listing in this file: https://github.com/DefiLlama/defillama-server/blob/master/defi/src/protocols/data2.ts, you can  edit it there and put up a PR
5. Do not edit/push `package-lock.json` file as part of your changes, we use lockfileVersion 2, and most use v1 and using that messes up our CI
6. No need to go to our discord and announce that you've created a PR, we monitor all PRs and will review it asap

##### Short Description (to be shown on DefiLlama):
The native ERC-20 Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI) Utility Token is fundamental to the decentralized operations, governance, and growth of the AI Protocol.

The ALI Token is a blockchain-agnostic asset that can be used for creating assets, providing liquidity, staking, transacting, accessing AI Services, upgrading tokenized assets, governing the AI Protocol, rewarding various forms of user and creator participation, and much more.

On the Protocol level, the ALI Token serves to regulate, incentivize, and reward the various participants of the AI Protocol. As a decentralized protocol with a variety of participants engaging in complex tasks, the AI Protocol requires a native utility token to not only function efficiently but to grow using the inherent advantages of token network effects.
